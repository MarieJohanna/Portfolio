              <p>
                  To pursue my interest in web development and to stimulate
                  my creativity I recently took a 12 weeks long
                  coding Boot Camp covering HTML, CSS, JavaScript
                  including React and node which I took at <a href="www.technigo.io">Technigo</a>.
              </p>
              <p>
                  After completing my business degree I started my career in Finance working with
                  Treasury at Swedish multinational companies. After 5 years I decided to try
                  business/it consulting at a FinTech consultancy firm. The IT involvement in
                  all my previsous roles was starting point for my web development interest.

              <h3>Travel</h3>
              <p>
                  I highly enjoy cultural interaction and meeting new people,
                  therefore I try to travel whenever I have the time and the opportunity.
                  I find myself an adventurous person and I have seen a lot of
                  places around the world thoughout my life.

              <h3>personality & interests</h3>
              <p>
                  I spend a few hours weekly on exercising everything from yogo to
                  spinning and weightlifting. I find it important to have an active
                  lifestyle as it gives me energy, enjoyment and strength.
              </p>
              <p>
                  When I was a child I used to only wear pink, preferrably
                  dresses or skirts, I know, very girly. Since then I have added
                  other colors and type of clothes to my wardrob but I still
                  pursue my interested in dresses by designing dresses for myself.
