              <p>I am an outgoing and optimistic person who loves meeting new
                people and to encounter new cultures. I have since an early
                age travelled a lot which has inspired me to later in life
                live in other countries. Until now I have lived in France,
                Colombia and Argentina and I currently live in Stockholm where
                I grew up as well.
              </p>
              <p>I have a business degree and have been working with Treasury
                and Finance for 5 years on the corporate side before I started
                as a business consultant for an IT-consultancy firm about a
                year ago. In my roles I have worked in a lot of different
                systems and platforms which is part of the inspiration for
                wanting to learn to code and what brought me to this course.
